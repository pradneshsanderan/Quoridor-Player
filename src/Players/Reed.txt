*** PART III (10 pt) ***

Is it a good idea to start the game with the Reed opening?

 I had initially used the Reed opening to play against the Dumb player before implementing the Reed player. I had played
 a total of 20 games using the Reed opening. I then measured the number of wins I had and
 the average number of turns it took me to win a game. As I was playing against the Dumb player, I had won every game. 
 However, the number of turns it took me to win the game was different from when I had  ot used the Reed opening. On average, it
 took me around 11 moves per game to win when not using the Reed opening and it took me around 13 moves per game when using
 the Reed opening. this is because the walls that I placed constricted my movement as well.
 After playing against the reed opening in 20 games, i can conclude that it is only a good opening if the person using the reed
 opening starts first. as only then does it constrict movements. whereas if the persob had started second and their opponent just
 moves forward, there isnt much issues. when I started first, my average number of moves to win was 12 but when i started second, my average
 was 15. Due to the fact that my minimax algorithm has issues, I was not able to test it with a smarter player, but when played
 with the dumb player, i would not consider it a good opening as it does not change the outcome of the game that
 drasticallly.
